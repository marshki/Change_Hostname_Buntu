# Change hostname in Buntu 

You may, for any number of reasons, need to change your rig's hostname. This Bash script allows you to do so interactively. Tested to work in Ubuntu, and should work in other Debian-based Linux OSs. 

## Usage 

**Proceed with caution. Please be sure that you understand what this code does. I assume zero liability if your rig goes to pot. Must run as root.**
